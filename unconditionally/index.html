                    <h2>introduction</h2>
                    <p>So i've recently become a rather big fan of <a href="http://www.mchnheart.com/" target="_blank"><u>machineheart</u></a>'s work, and i was going through some of their old videos (covers) and comparing them to the originals, and one pairing in particular caught my eye: <u><i>Unconditionally</i></u>, originally by <u>katy perry</u>. The contrast between the two approaches was huge, and i couldn't help but take some time to analyse how that made me feel. To put it lightly, <u>katy perry</u>'s video was not my fav.</p>

                    <p>Of course, just saying <q>i didn't like that video meh meh mah</q> isn't very productive. And so, i've set out to look a little deeper&mdash;what was it about <u>machineheart</u>'s act that made me appreciate it so much more? Well, let's find out.</p>

                    <h2>lyrical analysis</h2>
                    <p>When it comes to the signification of meaning in <u><i>Unconditionally</i></u>, a great deal of weight is placed on the lyrics. Note that, this being music, this need not necessarily be the case; even for <a href="http://youtu.be/QFAfWH_CKVw" target="_blank">a song with lyrics</a>, significance can exist largely external to (although perhaps not independent from) verse; however, <u><i>Unconditionally</i></u>, acting as a sort of monologue or, perhaps, a letter, definitely places emphasis on its words as the "what" which is said.</p>
                    <p>And so it is here we will begin, looking first the lyrical content of the songs, then the extralyrical elements of the music, and then finally the videos which has been associated with each, analysing each first on its own merit and then in relationship to the whole, and hopefully learning something along the way. If you haven't yet had the lyrics in front of you, i've uploaded them <a href="!INFO!/lyrics/" target="_blank">here</a>; i suggest you take a look before continuing. Something about the act of reading them, at least for me, casts things in a somewhat different, and illuminating, light.</p>

                        <h3>context</h3>
                        <p><q>Oh, no</q>, an expression of doubt, of worry; an apology, perhaps&mdash;and so the song begins. This is not a timeless expression of love, it is a response, a reassurance, an attempt at a resolution. We are not told what went down to warrant such a response, but we can guess: </p>
                        <p>And it is into this situation that we find ourselves, the audience, dropped, as a third party, at a distance, observing.</p>
