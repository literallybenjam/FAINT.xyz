                    <h2>introduction</h2>
                    <p>I first got into <u>innuendo studios</u> (<u>ian danskin</u>)'s work (as was the case with many ppl, i'm sure) when <a href="https://twitter.com/notch"><u>@notch</u></a> (<u>markus persson</u>) tweeted <u><i>This Is Phil Fish</i></u>, a video on internet fame and celebrity. The commentary was thoughtful and relevant (and is perhaps even more so in light of recent events), the rhetorical style was straightforward yet complex, and the video served to nicely complement and engage with what the audio was saying.</p>

                    <p>More recently, <u>innuendo studios</u> <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1569763410/innuendo-studios" target="_blank">ran a kickstarter</a> (successfully) to fund <em>even more videos</em>, and on <time datetime="2015-02-09">9 feb</time> released the first of these. Titled <u><i>Blood Is Compulsory: How We Talk About Advanced Warfare</i></u> (henceforth, <u><i>BIC</i></u>), the video is exactly what it claims to be, a critical analysis of the way <u><i>Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare</i></u> is discussed and represented in modern media, and, more broadly, an unmasking (of sorts) of aspects of games criticism as a whole. To the extent that <u><i>BIC</i></u> can be described as a criticism of criticism, this essay attempts to be a criticism of <em>that</em>, taking a deeper look at the messages, methodology, and implications of the work.</p>
                    <p>That, or it's just me ranting about a video i found interesting and relevant. Your choice.</p>

                <section id="author">
                    <h2>the present author</h2>
                    <p>In his 1967 essay <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_the_Author" target="_blank"><u><i>Death of the Author</i></u></a>, <u>roland barthes</u> argues that to attempt to connect a text with its real-life author necessarily limits the multiplicity of meanings that the text might hold. Trying to fit a text into a certain ideology and historical background masks intepretations that might exist beyond that context, and that it might be better-suited to think of the creator of a text as more of a scriptor (transcriber) of ideas than their <u>author</u>.</p>
                    <p>This is relevant because "the author" is made reference to in the very first sentence of <u><i>BIC</i></u>: <q>Back in the day, after years of begging, my&mdash;</q>; right there, <q>my</q>. And it is important to note that the author present in the film, the <i>i</i>, so to speak, is more-or-less entirely self-contained by the work. What we know <em>for sure</em> about <u>innuendo studios</u> is only what the film tells us about <u>innuendo studios</u>&mdash;or rather, our interpretation of what the film tells us. So when i say <q><u>innuendo studios</u> says this</q> or <q><u>innuendo studios</u> does that</q>, it's important to keep in mind that i'm not talking about <u>ian-danskin</u>-the-real-life-person <u>innuendo studios</u>, but rather my interpretation as-such through the film. I wouldn't dare presume to know what the <em>actual</em> <u>ian danskin</u> thinks or is trying to say, but i <em>can</em> talk about what my image of <u>innuendo studios</u> is saying <em>to me</em>.</p>
                    <p>Having said all that, the author plays an important role in <u><i>BIC</i></u>, and it is no accident that a personal anecdote is used to start the film. The reason for this&mdash;one of them, anyway&mdash;comes down to language. We like to think of language&mdash;or, perhaps, <em>languages</em>&mdash;in terms of, say, <u>english</u> and <u>french</u>, but the fact of the matter is that things are far more nuanced. Within the realm of <u>english</u>, we have technical language,  academic language, streetspeak, regional dialects, kitty pidgin, subcultural slang… and these different linguistic contexts, backgrounds, and use-cases intersect to create what becomes, broadly speaking, one's "language". In this sense, no two persons speak exactly the same thing&mdash;moreover, since most of us will talk differently to, say, parents, employers, close friends, and relationship partners, respectively, we are all (in a manner of speaking) multilingual.</p>

                    </figure>
                    <p>"Gamers", both as a subculture and more broadly, have a unique language. <u>Errant signal</u> speaks to this wrt violence (quoted below), but i think that the point could be extended to include other content as well. And this isn't to say that this language is universal, either; it varies by platform, community, genre, publisher&mdash;in the case of mmos, maybe even subculture within the game.</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>It's gotten to a point where words like <i>die</i>, <i>kill</i>, <i>gun</i>, and <i>shoot</i> all have a different meaning in the context of games, totally dissociated from their real-world counterparts. Have you ever been in a public restaurant talking about a recent round of <u><i>Team Fortress</i></u> or <i><u>Call of Duty</u></i>, only to get weird stares from everyone around you when you start talking about how you sniped that dude in the head?</p>
                        <footer><cite><u>errant signal</u> : <a href="http://youtu.be/wSBn77_h_6Q?t=10m26s" target="_blank"><u><i>Violence In Games</i></u></a></cite></footer>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>So when <u>innuendo studios</u> starts off talking about wanting his parents to buy him a <u>sega genesis</u>, he's doing more than ranting on about his childhood. He's letting us know what context he comes from: someone who plays games, but not quite up-with-the-times enough to be considered a hardcore "gamer"; a <u>sega</u> and <u>nintendo</u> kid; someone who plays on pc, but certainly not anything high-end and probably not online. He's also speaking in a casual, modern way&mdash;phrases like <q>y'know</q> and <q>i have shitty wi-fi</q> clue you in that he's not talking from some high-and-mighty place of authority.</p>
                    <p>This is <em>especially</em> important because <u>innuendo studios</u> makes claims like <q>1. The review is not for me.</q> This only works because we all know&mdash;because the film makes it very clear&mdash;what <i>me</i> means in the language <u>innuendo studios</u> is speaking. <dfn><i>Me</i></dfn> is shorthand for <i>a behind-the-times sega-and-nintendo-with-outdated-pc game-player-but-not-quite-gamer</i>, and the tone of the film would change <em>drastically</em> if that weren't the case&mdash;if, instead, <i>me</i> signified, say, <i>a <u>xbox</u>-loyal hardcore-gamer <u><i>Call of Duty</i></u> fan</i>.</p>
                    <p>And, again, this is all contained <em>within the film</em>&mdash;none of this is based on outside knowledge i may have picked up somewhere about <u>ian danskin</u> and his gaming habits. <u>Innuendo studios</u> utilizes the author as a literary device to give us important linguistic context that allows us to frame and interpret his arguments in the&mdash;i hesitate to say <q>intended</q>, but…&mdash;well, in a certain way.</p>

                <section id="interesting">
                    <h2>subjectivity of message</h2>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>…but me, what i'm curious about is, is it a good performance?</p>
                        <footer><u>innuendo studios</u> : <u><i>BIC</i></u></footer>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>The author serves another purpose in <u><i>BIC</i></u>, though, as a marker of subjectivity. <u>Innuendo studios</u> doesn't say whether things are good or bad&mdash;he asks as much, sometimes, but there's no value judgement there. Never in watching this film do i get the sense that there is a single right opinion to be had about <u>Call of Duty</u> or <u>Call of Duty</u> journalism. Instead we here words and phrases like <i>interesting</i>, <i>fascinating</i>, <i>i think</i>, <i>i feel</i>, terminology which betrays the subjective nature of the opinions that it conveys&mdash;this is someone sharing their feelings with me, not some handing-down of emperical fact.</p>
                    <p>And i find this approach beneficial, especially when talking about a topic so broad and nuanced as <q>how we talk about <u><i>Advanced Warfare</i></u></q>. If <u>innuendo studios</u> was to say, for example, that the glowing reviews of <u>Call of Duty</u> were <em>bad</em>… Well, he'd either be right or he wouldn't. And we could have that argument all day, but in the end, that's what we'd be doing: arguing. You either agree or you don't.</p>
                    <p>But instead what <u>innuendo studios</u> says is that <q>everything above 90 is not bad but, like, boring.</q> Boring… Again, a very subjective word. If i walk out of a theatre and say <q>ug, that movie was so <em>boring</em></q>, you can say <q>well i didn't think so</q>, but you can't really make the claim <q>no, your experiences are wrong</q>. Because that's what <i>boring</i> is, that's what <i>interesting</i>, <i>fascinating</i> is, an experience. And so when you say <q>i had this experience</q>, someone else can say <q>well i experienced something different</q>, you can have that conversation, but that's what it becomes, a conversation, not an argument.</p>
                    <p>And this is <em>not to say</em> that this film is just <u>innuendo studios</u> ranting his personal experiences at us, that there aren't any deeper meanings or larger points being made here about games or the conversations they generate. But it is to say that those deeper meanings are <em>also</em> subjective, that i can't talk about this film and say <q>this is what <u>innuendo studios</u> wants me to think</q>, i can only say <q>this is what i personally got out of it</q>. Because none of his points are set in stone, they are all subjective, open to interpretation, able to be cast aside or scrutinized or reworked or analysed.</p>
                    <p>There is certainly meaning in <u><i>BIC</i></u>, if you want there to be. What experiences are related, what points are made, how they are arranged within the film… these all hint at something which looks suspiciously like authorial intent. I can't watch the film and not think <q>there is something here for me to uncover</q>. But the work is left to the audience to unmask what exactly that meaning might be.</p>

                    <h2>the review as the thing itself</h2>
                    <p>Now, up to this point i've been talking mostly about <u>innuendo studios</u> himself&mdash;his methods, his rhetoric, that sort of thing&mdash;and not so much about the things he is actually discussing. This is partially on purpose: I don't want to tell you how to read his points, and honestly, reviews of <u><i>Call of Duty</i></u> aren't something that i have a huge interest in. But i think that there is one parallel within <u><i>BIC</i></u> that maybe deserves a little more unpacking, and that is the similarities of situation of the review, and the thing it is reviewing.</p>
                    <p>I want to first look at something <u>innuendo studios</u> says in his second point: <q>if they go into a review with an expectation of what it will say and what they want to find is more or less what they expected, what was the point of reading it?</q> And i think that this question can be directly applied not only to reviews, but to the games they are reviewing: If ppl go into a game with an expecation of how it will play and what they want to find is more or less what they expected, what was the point of playing it? And i think that the answer to both of these questions are more or less the same, that there is a certain comfort to be had in going into something and finding exactly what you expected, to not being challenged but affirmed, to having your expectations lauded as valid and worthwhile.</p>
                    <p>And so we find ourselves in a situation where asking why <u>Call of Duty</u> reviews are all the same is not all that different from asking why all <u>Call of Duty</u> <em>games</em> are much the same, or why all bestselling aaa games are shooters. And, credit to him, <u>innuendo studios</u> directly responds to this question.</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>But what’s the point in asking that? What’s the point of asking “why wasn’t BioShock Infinite an adventure game?” Because that would have made more sense, but it doesn’t matter, that game wouldn’t get funded.</p>
                        <footer><u>innuendo studios</u> : <u><i>BIC</i></u></footer>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>"Triple-a" <u>Call of Duty</u> reviews are all the same, they all follow the same formula, talking about the single-player story and game mechanics while ignoring the larger questions, because that's what gets views, that's what gets pageclicks, that's what gets funded. If you're writing a review for a big website like <u>polygon</u> or <u>ign</u>, it's going to end in a score. And if you want to make a larger point about games as a medium, you gotta hang that on a score, because that's what makes money.</p>
                    <p>And you can find value in that, or you can question it, and to an extent i think <u>innuendo studios</u> does both. But this expectation, this expectation of reviews as necessarily reductionist pieces which overlook larger implications of the works they discuss, seems to have worked its way into even that media which is critical of these structures. <q>Everything above a 90</q>, <u>innuendo studios</u> remarks, as if that were the sole takeaway that the review was trying to provide.</p>
                    <p>And this brings me to my last point. <u>Innuendo studios</u> talks about game reviews only in relation to other game reviews; <q>how does this review stack up against the last review i read?</q> And if game reviews are only held to the standards of other game reviews, they have become functionally their own genre. They have genre trappings and genre expectations, and asking <q>why does this review care so much about mechanics?</q> feels like asking <q>why is <u>Call of Duty</u> so pro-military?</q> That's just what it is.</p>
                    <p>But even as he reinforces these expectations, we find within his arguments a means of subverting them. <u><i>BIC</i></u>, while clearly not a "review" in the traditional sense, provides exactly the sort of engagement that <u>innuendo studios</u> finds lacking elsewhere, treating <u><i>Call of Duty</i></u> not as a bundle of story and mechanics ready to be evaluated, but as a cultural phenomenon, engagable not only at the level of being but at the levels of perception, presentation, and discourse. And while he perhaps raises more questions than he gives answers, this isn't necessarily a bad thing, as <u>innuendo studios</u> engages in the art of not telling you what to think, but helping you reach that conclusion for yourself.</p>
