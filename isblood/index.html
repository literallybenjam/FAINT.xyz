                    <h2>introduction</h2>
                    <p>I first got into <u>innuendo studios</u> (<u>ian danskin</u>)'s work (as many was the case with many ppl, i'm sure) when <a href="https://twitter.com/notch"><u>@notch</u></a> (<u>markus persson</u>) tweeted <u><i>This Is Phil Fish</i></u>, a video on internet fame and celebrity. The commentary was thoughtful and relevant (and is perhaps even more so in light of recent events), the rhetorical style was straightforward yet complex, and the video served to nicely complement and engage with what was being said.</p>

                    <p>More recently, <u>innuendo studios</u> <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1569763410/innuendo-studios" target="_blank">ran a kickstarter</a> (successfully) to fund <em>even more videos</em>, and on <time datetime="2015-02-09">9 feb</time> released the first of these. Titled <u><i>Blood Is Compulsory: How We Talk About Advanced Warfare</i></u> (henceforth, <u><i>BIC</i></u>), the video is exactly what it claims to be, a critical analysis of the way <u><i>Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare</i></u> is discussed and represented in modern media, and (more broadly) an unmasking (of sorts) of aspects of games criticism as a whole. To the extent that <u><i>BIC</i></u> can be described as a criticism of criticism, this essay attempts to be a criticism of <em>that</em>, taking a deeper look at the messages, methodology, and implications of the work.</p>
                    <p>That, or it's just me ranting about a video i found interesting and relevant. Your choice.</p>

                <section id="author">
                    <h2>the present author</h2>
                    <p>In his 1967 essay <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_the_Author" target="_blank"><u><i>Death of the Author</i></u></a>, <u>roland barthes</u> argues that to attempt to connect a text with its real-life author necessarily limits the multiplicity of meanings that the text might hold. Trying to fit a text into a certain ideology and historical background masks intepretations that might exist beyond that context, and that it might be better-suited to think of the creator of a text as more of a scriptor (transcriber) of ideas than their <u>author</u>.</p>
                    <p>This is relevant because "the author" is made reference to in the very first sentence of <u><i>BIC</i></u>: <q>Back in the day, after years of begging, my&mdash;</q>; right there, <q>my</q>. And it is important to note that the author present in the film, the <i>i</i>, so to speak, is more-or-less entirely self-contained by the work. What we know <em>for sure</em> about <u>innuendo studios</u> is only what the film tells us about <u>innuendo studios</u>&mdash;or rather, our interpretation of what the film tells us. So when i say <q><u>innuendo studios</u> says this</q> or <q><u>innuendo studios</u> does that</q>, it's important to keep in mind that i'm not talking about <u>ian-danskin</u>-the-real-life-person <u>innuendo studios</u>, but rather my interpretation as-such through the film. I wouldn't dare presume to know what the <em>actual</em> <u>ian danskin</u> thinks or is trying to say, but i <em>can</em> talk about what my image of <u>innuendo studios</u> is saying <em>to me</em>.</p>
                    <p>Having said all that, the author plays an important role in <u><i>BIC</i></u>, and it is no accident that a personal anecdote is used to start the film. The reason for this&mdash;one of them, anyway&mdash;comes down to language. We like to think of language&mdash;or, perhaps, <em>languages</em>&mdash;in terms of, say, <u>english</u> and <u>french</u>, but the fact of the matter is that things are more nuanced than that. Within the realm of <u>english</u>, we have technical language, scientific language, academic language, streetspeak, regional dialects, subcultural slang… and these different linguistic contexts, backgrounds, and use-cases intersect to create what becomes, broadly speaking, one's "language". In this sense, no two people speak exactly the same language&mdash;moreover, since most of us speak differently to, say, parents, employers, close friends, and relationship partners, respectively, we are all multilingual.</p>
                    <p>"Gamers", both as a subculture and more broadly, have a unique language. <u>Errant signal</u> speaks to this wrt violence (quoted below), but i think that the point could be extended to include other content as well. And this isn't to say that this language is universal, either; it varies by platform, community, genre, publisher&mdash;in the case of mmo's, maybe even subculture within the game.</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>It's gotten to a point where words like <i>die</i>, <i>kill</i>, <i>gun</i>, and <i>shoot</i> all have a different meaning in the context of games, totally dissociated from their real-world counterparts. Have you ever been in a public restaurant talking about a recent round of <u><i>Team Fortress</i></u> or <i><u>Call of Duty</u></i>, only to get weird stares from everyone around you when you start talking about how you sniped that dude in the head?</p>
                        <footer><cite><u>errant signal</u> : <a href="http://youtu.be/wSBn77_h_6Q?t=10m26s" target="_blank"><u><i>Violence In Games</i></u></a></cite></footer>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>So when <u>innuendo studios</u> starts off talking about wanting his parents to buy him a <u>sega genesis</u>, he's doing more than ranting on about his childhood. He's letting us know what context he comes from: someone who plays games, but not quite up-with-the-times enough to be considered a hardcore "gamer"; a <u>sega</u> and <u>nintendo</u> kid; someone who plays pc games, but certainly not anything high-end and probably not online. He's also speaking in a casual, modern way&mdash;phrases like <q>y'know</q> and <q>i have shitty wi-fi</q> clue you in that he's not talking from some high-and-mighty place of authority.</p>
                    <p>This is <em>especially</em> important, because <u>innuendo studios</u> makes claims like <q>1. The review is not for me.</q> This only works because we all know&mdash;because the film makes it very clear&mdash;what <i>me</i> means in the language <u>innuendo studios</u> uses. <dfn><i>Me</i></dfn> is shorthand for <i>behind-the-times sega-and-nintendo-with-outdated-pc game-player-but-not-quite-gamer</i>, and the tone of the film would change <em>drastically</em> if that weren't the case&mdash;if, instead, <i>me</i> signified, say, <i><u>xbox</u>-loyal hardcore <u><i>Call of Duty</i></u> fan</i>.</p>
                    <p>And, again, this is all contained <em>within the film</em>&mdash;none of this is based on outside knowledge i may have picked up somewhere about <u>ian danskin</u> and his gaming habits. <u>Innuendo studios</u> utilizes the author as a literary device to give us important linguistic context that allows us to frame and interpret his arguments in the&mdash;i hesitate to say <q>intended</q>, but…&mdash;well, in a certain way.</p>
