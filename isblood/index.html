                    <h2>introduction</h2>
                    <p>I first got into <u>innuendo studios</u> (<u>ian danskin</u>)'s work (as many was the case with many ppl, i'm sure) when <a href="https://twitter.com/notch"><u>@notch</u></a> (<u>markus persson</u>) tweeted <u><i>This Is Phil Fish</i></u>, a video on internet fame and celebrity. The commentary was thoughtful and relevant (and is perhaps even more so in light of recent events), the rhetorical style was straightforward yet complex, and the video served to nicely complement and engage with what was being said.</p>

                        <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>So this video happened just as I&#39;m thinking about these things: <a href="https://t.co/CGtBKZj3zM">https://t.co/CGtBKZj3zM</a></p>&mdash; Markus Persson (@notch) <a href="https://twitter.com/notch/status/479154407775674368">June 18, 2014</a></blockquote>

                    <p>More recently, <u>innuendo studios</u> <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1569763410/innuendo-studios" target="_blank">ran a kickstarter</a> (successfully) to fund <em>even more videos</em>, and on <time datetime="2015-02-09">9 feb</time> released the first of these. Titled <u><i>Blood Is Compulsory: How We Talk About Advanced Warfare</i></u> (henceforth, <u><i>BIC</i></u>), the video is exactly what it claims to be, a critical analysis of the way <u><i>Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare</i></u> is discussed and represented in modern media, and (more broadly) an unmasking of sorts of aspects of games criticism as a whole. To the extent that <u><i>BIC</i></u> can be described as a criticism of criticism, this essay attempts to be a criticism of <em>that</em>, taking a deeper look at the messages, methodology, and implications of the work.</p>
                    <p>That, or it's just me ranting about a video i found interesting and relevant. Your choice.</p>
