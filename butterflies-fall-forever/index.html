                    <h2>introduction</h2>
                    <p>I first came across <u>he is we</u>'s music in the form of their <a href="https://heiswe.bandcamp.com/album/old-demos" target="_blank"><u><i>Old Demos</i></u></a>, which i found while browsing <u>bandcamp</u> a few years back. It was a touch on the expensive side ($5, lol) but people's opinions seemed positive and after listening to a few tracks i figured <q>hey, why not</q>. It filled a genre niche (lovingly referred to as <i>shitty pop</i>) missing in my music library, and the songs were genuinely enjoyable to listen to. This was 2012, at the start of my freshman year of college.</p>
                    <p>In 2013, i picked up their ep, <u><i>Skip to the Good Part</i></u>, and honestly it took me a while to appreciate it. <u>Aaron gillespie</u>'s performance in the opening track threw me off (still does; one of the strengths of <u>he is we</u>'s music is its one-sided nature), and the tracks as a whole had a polished slightly over-the top sound i wasn't really used to. I liked <u><i>Skip to the Good Part</i></u>, though, and eventually the album grew on me as a whole.</p>
                    <p>At the end of 2014, i finally purchased <u><i>My Forever</i></u>, for the most part completing my collection. And, like <u><i>Skip to the Good Part</i></u>, many of the songs threw me for a loop the first time around, but gradually grew on me as time went on and i gained a greater understanding of them.</p>
                    <p>Now, <u>he is we</u>'s songs can be very problematic. This is something i noticed from the beginning, and at first i wrote it off with <q>well, it's shitty pop; shitty pop is allowed to be problematic.</q> But that's not really true; firstly, shitty pop <em>isn't</em> just "allowed" to be problematic, it's as political and influential as the rest of it, maybe more so; secondly, rather than subtracting from the experience, the problematic nature of the tracks actually made me like them <em>more</em>. This was something that had to be reconciled: What is it about this music that makes its problematic messages add to the experience? How can that be a good thing?</p>
                    <p>This line of inquiry is what eventually led me down the rabbit-hole into these songs' deeper meaning. Or, i should say, my deeper interpretation of them. For another strength of this music is that it will invariably mean something different to every person who hears it, and my connecting-of-the-dots is no more valid or justified than anyone else's. But i hope that by analysing my own interpretations, we can maybe uncover something about messages, media, and methods of storytelling as a whole.</p>
