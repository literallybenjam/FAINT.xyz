                <aside><p>This piece was originally composed (albeit in a somewhat different format) for <u>WLIT 395</u>, <u><i>contemporary literary theory</i></u>, spring 2015, <u>whitman college</u>.</p></aside>
                <p>A girl walks down the street. We know next to nothing about her, the very fact of her movement is left unspoken, and yet we feel for her a certain affinity: She speaks to us without opening her mouth; she imagines the life of another; she finishes her day as we finish her story.</p>
                <p>In a café, another girl (perhaps the same one?) sits with her date, surrounded everywhere by a dazzling beauty; she sees a poor father with two children, and reads into their eyes what their lips dare not speak. She finds there a kind of joy, beauty; her date reads something else, the two do not agree. <q>Feminine impermeability,</q> the girl calls it, this uncommunicability of thought.</p>
                <p>And then we have a man, cynical, analysing the events around him rather than taking part, walking through a festival, critical of the commotion he sees. He finds there an old acrobat, looking out upon the masses, and the image brings him feel a deep sorrow, for in this acrobat he sees himself, his future, forgotten.</p>
                <p>So transpire the events of <u><i>Windows</i></u>, <u><i>The Eyes of the Poor</i></u>, and <u><i>The Old Acrobat</i></u>, a trio of prose-poems by <u>charles baudelaire</u> appearing in his collection <u><i>The Parisian Prowler</i></u>. Each is little more than a moment, a glimpse into the life of another. But within these moments&mdash;or, perhaps, through them&mdash;there lies something hidden, waiting to be unmasked, created. For the narrators in these stories are more than just characters, they are authors, readers, critics, and their story speaks powerfully about the nature of art itself.</p>
                <p><q>He who looks from the outside through a window open never sees as much as he who looks through a window closed,</q> <u>baudelaire</u> writes. And, indeed, in these stories much is closed to us. We have the aging acrobat, never speaking, never moving; we have the poor father and his children, who simply stand and stare; we have the old woman glimpsed in the window, little more than a face and a figure. There is a beauty in obscurity, here.</p>
                <p>But why? What purpose could the obscuring of information possibly serve? <q>No deeper, more mysterious, more fertile, more obscure, more dazzling object exists…</q> And what is doing the obscuring? A window closed, a pane of glass. The image obscuring our vision is none other than our own reflection.</p>
                <p>We see this, too, in the other source of inspiration for <u>baudelaire</u>'s narrators, the eyes, another reflective surface, a window to the soul—whose soul? <q>I turned my gaze toward yours, dear love, in order to read my thought there.</q> When we look at others, we see in them images of ourselves. We fashion their history to make sense within our experiences, to provide us with meaning, to service our needs. <q>I go to bed, proud of having lived and suffered in others than myself.</q></p>
                <p>But this meaning can only be found within an obscured image. Take, for example, the woman in the window: the narrator creates meaning <q>with her face, her clothing, her gestures, with almost nothing.</q>. She is but an outline, a cartoon. <q>The cartoon is a vacuum into which our identity and awareness are pulled… an empty shell that we inhabit which enables us to travel to another realm,</q> <u>scott mccloud</u> remarks in <u><i>Understanding Comics</i></u>. <q>You give me life by reading this book and by "filling up" this very iconic (cartoony) form.</q> The ability one has to inhabit the Other is blocked by detail, which creates difference, and thus alienation. Indeed, in <u><i>The Eyes of the Poor</i></u>, when the lover reveals her true feelings, the response is hatred, a shattering of illusion, of love. In <u><i>The Old Acrobat</i></u>, the narrator refrains from asking the acrobat to perform, for fear of destroying his mysticism, his sorrow, replacing it with humiliation.</p>
                <p>This relationship between the viewer and the viewed is demonstrated perhaps nowhere better than within <u>baudelaire</u>'s poetry itself. In all three poems, the narrators, like the acrobat, the poor family, and the old woman, are mute and motionless&mdash;neither their lips nor their bodies move. We see the world through their eyes, and these eyes, like the pane of glass, reflect back on us mirror images of ourselves even as they let us gaze into another world. We know nothing of the narrator, the situation, and where i read a girl walking down the street, another might read an old man on a bicycle, or a dog in a car. We fill the holes in the stories with pieces of ourselves, and through this process, create meaning.</p>
                <p>Unlike the mirrors in the stories, however, when we read, <a href="https://twitter.com/officialjaden/status/329768040235413504" target="_blank">the eyes we gaze through aren't real</a>. And this offers them a kind of potency: The narrator, unlike the lover, cannot break the illusion, cannot protest the imposition of our will; as readers, we can pick and choose passages as we fancy, we can relate the texts however we see fit, and through this process, we can generate a larger meaning. And when faced with the question of whether our reading of a text is "correct"— whether we have unmasked its "true meaning"—we find the answer inconsequential. <q>Does it matter,</q> <u>baudelaire</u> writes, <q>what the reality located outside me might be, if it has helped me to live, to feel that I am and what I am?</q></p>
                <p>This ability to interpret&mdash;to live through&mdash;a text, however, is not without cost. And as much as <u>baudelaire</u>'s poetry gives us insight into our nature as readers, it also serves as a warning to those trying to share their messages with others. For we are not the only audience found within <u>baudelaire</u>'s works. In <u><i>The Old Acrobat</i></u>, we are presented with the scene of a festival, one admittedly of the author's own imagination, and an audience, the crowds. And they are enjoying themselves: <q>Everywhere joy, profit, debauchery; everywhere the certainty of tomorrow's bread; everywhere the frenzied explosion of vitality.</q> But despite their enthusiasm <a href="http://youtu.be/jdQYzEc6wYw" target="_blank">(the etymology of which they epitomize)</a>, the audience misses that which the author finds most important: The old acrobat, wretched, alone, unnoticed; indeed, amidst the crowds, even the narrator, the critic, is swept away from this meaning.</p>
                <p>In an interview for the documentary <u><i>Indie Game: the Movie</i></u>, <u>jonathon blow</u> makes the following comment about creating a work of art: <q>When you work a long time on something intricate like that, there's a hope... that you'll have some line of communication with your audience, and things like that. ...And they think it's great, but the connection isn't there, because they're kinda living in a different world still.</q> We see this sentiment clearly in the festival scene, in the crowds of people, enjoying themselves, but overlooking significance. And this is the casualty caused by the reflective nature of art: Our reflection sometimes obscures the meaning that the author intended us to find.</p>
                <p>A work need not be well-received for this to be the case, of course, and in <u><i>The Eyes of the Poor</i></u> we see the relationship between the author and the reader played out in full. At first, the two are lovers, embarking on a singular journey: <q>We had indeed promised each other that all our thoughts would be shared with each other, and that our two souls would henceforth form but one.</q> And, at first, the experience is wonderful; indeed, <q>the café was sparkling.</q> But when the author introduces the message, the poor family, the reader, not knowing their significance, disregards them, finds them unnecessary, asks them to be sent away. And although it is the reader who described as impermeable, it is the author's intention that is overlooked. <q>How difficult it is to understand one another,</q> <u>baudelaire</u> exclaims; <q>how uncommunicable thought is, even among people who love each other!</q></p>
                <p>In the end, though, does this uncommunicability of authorial intention even matter? The author, like the acrobat, grows old with time; the meaning she creates fades and loses relevance; the audience finds significance elsewhere or else simply moves on. To the narrator of <u><i>The Old Acrobat</i></u>, the critic, this is cause for sadness; to the narrator of <u><i>The Eyes of the Poor</i></u>, the author, this is cause for hatred; to the narrator of <u><i>Windows</i></u>, the reader, this is cause for joy.</p>
                <p><u>Baudelaire</u> leaves this difference of opinion unresolved, and perhaps this is for the better. For <u>baudelaire</u>'s poetry is, like the various objects he describes, a reflective surface, and to cast such a value judgement could perhaps tarnish the reflection beyond repair. And, perhaps, there is no "right" answer, only interpretation, a personal filling in of the blanks. But <u>baudelaire</u>'s writing directs us to the method even if it does not preordain a result, and in doing so he prompts us to examine our interactions with literature, art, the thing itself. This sort of critical examination, too, produces a sort of meaning, one not directed towards the works we engage with, but rather inward, towards ourselves.</p>
